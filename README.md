 the results of my latest project, where I applied data analysis techniques to evaluate and visualize sales performance across different products, regions, and customer segments. Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I worked through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization to uncover valuable insights that could drive better business decisions.
The analysis involved several key steps:

Data Cleaning: Removing missing values, transforming data types (such as date fields), and handling outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summarizing key metrics such as total sales, average sales per product, and sales per region.

Data Visualization: Using pie charts, bar charts, and scatterplots to visualize the distribution of sales across categories and regions.
üîç Key Insights and Takeaways:
Top-Performing Products: Identified the highest-selling products, offering critical insights into what drives revenue.
Sales by Region: Analyzed sales performance across regions, with the West region showing above-average sales and the South region representing a significant growth opportunity. The Eastern region had the lowest sales.
Customer Segmentation: Gained an understanding of how sales are distributed across customer segments, which can lead to more targeted marketing strategies.
Bottom-Performing Products: Pinpointed the bottom 10 products by sales, helping us identify underperforming products and explore potential strategies for improvement, such as better marketing or product adjustments.
Trends Over Time: Explored sales trends, revealing that 2016 had the lowest sales while 2018 had the highest. Additionally, October 2018 marked the highest sales across all months.
üí° Additional Key Findings:
The electronics category contributed over 40% of total sales, making it a key driver of overall performance.
The home goods category showed a decline in sales, indicating that targeted promotions could help boost performance.

This project has provided a comprehensive understanding of sales trends, customer behaviors, and product performance, offering actionable insights for optimizing sales strategies. I‚Äôm excited to continue applying these techniques and insights in future business challenges.
